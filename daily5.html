						<h2>A Language Arts Structure</h2>

<p>The Daily Five is a literacy structure that allows for differentiation in the classroom and provides consistency</p>
					<p><small>2/10</small></p>
				</section>

	<section>
					


<p>It is an integrated literacy instruction and classroom management system for use in reading and writing workshops</p>
					<p><small>3/10</small></p>
				</section>


				<section>
<p>It is a system of five literacy tasks that teaches students independence:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read to Self</li> <li>Read to Someone</li> <li>Listen to Reading</li> <li>Work on Writing</li><li>Working with Words</li>

</ul>

<h3>Further Explanation...</h3>
<p>The Daily Five is a way of structuring the Language Arts block so every student is
independently engaged in meaningful literacy tasks. These research-based tasks are ones that have the
biggest impact on student reading and writing achievement, while fostering a love of reading and
writing. </p>

					<p><small>5/10</small></p>
				</section>

		<section>
<h3>Action Plan...</h3>
<p>Students receive explicit whole group instruction related to the Standards of Learning (SOL)
for reading and writing and then are given practice time to read and write independently while teachers
provide focused, intense instruction to individuals and small groups of students. Students typically
participate in 2-4 of these activities daily, always including Read to Self. 
</p>

<h3>Expectations...</h3>
<p>There are specific behavior expectations for each Daily 5 component. We will spend our first
quarter working intensely on building student reading and writing stamina, learning the behaviors of
the Daily 5, and fostering our classroom community. Our teachers will also spend time learning about
your child’s strengths and greatest needs as a reader in order to best plan for his/her instruction. 
</p>

		<section>
<h2>Changes...</h2>
<p>One thing you’ll notice that may be a change for you is a direct decrease in the number of
worksheets your child brings home. While worksheets keep students busy, they don’t result in the high
level of learning we want for your child. 
</p>
					<p><small>8/10</small></p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Good Fit...</h2>
<p>Instead, your child will be taught to select “Good Fit Books”
or books they can read, understand and are interested in, which they will read during Daily 5. They
will be spending most of their time actually reading, which research supports as the number one way to
improve reading. </p>

<h2>Ask Us About it...</h2>
<p>We are excited about giving your child the opportunity to be involved in a structure that will
have a positive effect on his/her education.
If you are interested in more information feel free to contact the office and we will connect you with our reading team!</p>
